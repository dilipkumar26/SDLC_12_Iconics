The following table determines the integrated test plan

| **Test ID** | **Description**                                              |**Purpose**|**Status**|   
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|
|  T_01       |Check all the operations are selected as written in the code | To check if all choices are getting executed|Passed| 
|  T_02       |Checking for invalid inputs condition|To check whether non test cases based values are getting executed or not|Passed|
| T_03 | Checking whether all the operations are getting executed as per the order| To check if the entire code integrated is working or not|Passed|
| T_04 | Check for the condition when other variables or special character are given to the input choice operation | To check if the code is running properly to the requirement | Future Implementation |
| T_05| Check for negative value condition | To check for invalid input condition | Future implementation |
