## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Differentiating the Resistor bands based on its value (ohms). It was overcomed by looking into resistance sheet given by manufactures.
2. Tolerance Factor for each band. It was over comed by looking into which colour has which value of tolerance from the data sheet.
3. Number of bands based on Resistance value. It was overcomed by using manual checking.
4. Digital conversion from one unit to other. It was overcomed by reading the concepts from digital electronics from 12th standard electronics book.
5. Sine wave genaration problem using binary bits. It was overcomed by understanding the concept of sine wave.

## 4W AND H

# WHO
The Virtual Labs Project started as an initiative from the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD)

# WHERE
IIT Khatragpur INDIA

# WHAT
to create online interactive media which would help students learn difficult concepts in various domains. As a part of this initiative, a virtual laboratory for Basic Electronics has been developed. The objective of this lab is to perform experiments in the Basic Electronics labs virtually, and yet have close to real life experience

# WHEN
2010

# HOW
All Virtual Labs can be accessed through a common website which we create further in app devolopment. At the user end, a PC and broadband connectivity enables the user to access Virtual Labs.
