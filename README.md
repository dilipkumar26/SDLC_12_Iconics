## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Differentiating the Resistor bands based on its value (ohms). It was overcomed by looking into resistance sheet given by manufactures.
2. Tolerance Factor for each band. It was over comed by looking into which colour has which value of tolerance from the data sheet.
3. Number of bands based on Resistance value. It was overcomed by using manual checking.
4. Digital conversion from one unit to other. It was overcomed by reading the concepts from digital electronics from 12th standard electronics book.
