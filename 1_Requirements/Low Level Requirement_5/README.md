Gustav Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) is the second of his fundamental laws we can use for circuit analysis. His voltage law states that for a closed loop series path the algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero (ΣV = 0). This is because a circuit loop is a closed conducting path so no energy is lost.

For the above circuit, we get the following equation after applying KVL:
##  Vs -IR1 - IR2 = 0
