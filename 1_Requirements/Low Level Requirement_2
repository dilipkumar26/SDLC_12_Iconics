# RMS Value of Current and Voltage

Definition: The RMS value is the effective value of a varying voltage or current. It is the equivalent steady DC (constant) value which gives the same effect.
For example: For example, a lamp connected to a 6V RMS AC supply will shine with the same brightness when connected to a steady 6V DC supply.
