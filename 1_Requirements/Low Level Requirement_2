# RMS Value of Current and Voltage

Definition: The RMS value is the effective value of a varying voltage or current. It is the equivalent steady DC (constant) value which gives the same effect.
For example: For example, a lamp connected to a 6V RMS AC supply will shine with the same brightness when connected to a steady 6V DC supply.

## RMS Formula

RMS Voltage= peak voltage * 0.707 

# DC Power

Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.

## Power Formulas in DC Circuits

P = V x I
P = I2 x R
P = V2 / R
