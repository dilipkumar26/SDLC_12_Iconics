# RMS Value of Current and Voltage

Definition: The RMS value is the effective value of a varying voltage or current. It is the equivalent steady DC (constant) value which gives the same effect.
For example: For example, a lamp connected to a 6V RMS AC supply will shine with the same brightness when connected to a steady 6V DC supply.

## RMS Formula

RMS Voltage= peak voltage * 0.707 

# DC Power

Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.

## Power Formulas in DC Circuits

P = V x I

P = I2 x R

P = V2 / R

# Average Value
The average of all the instantaneous values of an alternating voltage and currents over one complete cycle is called Average Value.

## Average Current
### Definition:
If we convert the alternating current (AC) sine wave into direct current (DC) sine wave through rectifiers, then the converted value to the DC is known as the average value of that alternating current sine wave
### Formula:
Iavgx(π/ω) =  (2Im/ω)
Iavg = (2Im / π)

     Iavg   = 0.637Im

The average value of AC sinusoidal current or voltage is equal to 0.637 times of its peak value.

## Average Voltage
### Definition:
The average voltage (or current) of a periodic waveform whether it is a sine wave, square wave or triangular waveform is defined as: “the quotient of the area under the waveform with respect to time”.
### Formula:
     Average Value of Voltage = EAV = 0.637 EM
