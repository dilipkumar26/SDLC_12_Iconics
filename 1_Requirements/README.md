# Voltage Definition
Voltage is known as the electric potential difference between two points.
The Si unit for voltage is volts.
The difference in electrical potential is oftentimes caused by electric charge, electric current, or magnetic fields.
Sometimes, it’s decided by all three of those parameters.

# How is voltage measured?
To measure voltage a voltmeter is used.
This is connected to two opposite points along with a device, and the voltage drop across the device is known as the difference.
When using one of these reference points as ground, it provides the total voltage at that point.

# Voltage Formula
V = I * R   

Where V is the voltage
I is the current
R is the resistance

# Current Definition
Electric Current is the rate of flow of electrons in a conductor.
The magnitude of electric current is measured in coulombs per second.
The SI unit of electric current is Ampere and is denoted by the letter A.
Ampere is defined as one coulomb of charge moving past a point in one second. 
If there are 6.241 x 1018 electrons flowing through our frame in one second then the electrical current flowing through it is ‘One Ampere.’

# Current Formula
I=V/R
Where V is the voltage
R is the resistance

# What is Resistor Colour Code?
Resistors are usually very tiny, and it is challenging to print resistance values on them.
So, colour bands are printed on them to represent the electrical resistance. 
These colour bands are known as resistor colour code. The resistor colour code was invented in the 1920s by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA).

# Resistor Colour Reading

All leaded resistors with a power rating up to one watt are marked with colour bands.
They are given by several bands and together they specify the resistance value, the tolerance rate and sometimes the reliability or failure rates. 
The number of bands present in a resistor varies from three to six. 
The first two bands indicate the resistance value and the third band serves as a multiplier.

# Resistors in Series
The resistors R1, R2 ...., Rm in the circuit on the left side are said to be in series because the same current passes through them.
They behave in the same way as the circuit on the right of resistance Req given by the sum of the resistances R1, R2 and R3.
Req = R1 + R2 ....+ Rm
I = E / Req

# Resistors in Parallel
The voltage across each of the resistors R1, R2 ...., Rm in the circuit on the left is the same and therefore these resistors are said to be in parallel.
They behave in the same way as the circuit on the right of resistance Req that is given by the equation:
1 / Req = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + .... + 1 / Rm

# RMS Value of Current and Voltage

Definition: The RMS value is the effective value of a varying voltage or current. It is the equivalent steady DC (constant) value which gives the same effect.
For example: For example, a lamp connected to a 6V RMS AC supply will shine with the same brightness when connected to a steady 6V DC supply.
