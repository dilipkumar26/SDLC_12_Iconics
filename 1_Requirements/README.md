# Voltage Definition
Voltage is known as the electric potential difference between two points.
The Si unit for voltage is volts.
The difference in electrical potential is oftentimes caused by electric charge, electric current, or magnetic fields.
Sometimes, it’s decided by all three of those parameters.

# How is voltage measured?
To measure voltage a voltmeter is used.
This is connected to two opposite points along with a device, and the voltage drop across the device is known as the difference.
When using one of these reference points as ground, it provides the total voltage at that point.

# Voltage Formula
V = I * R   

Where V is the voltage
I is the current
R is the resistance

# Current Definition
Electric Current is the rate of flow of electrons in a conductor.
The magnitude of electric current is measured in coulombs per second.
The SI unit of electric current is Ampere and is denoted by the letter A.
Ampere is defined as one coulomb of charge moving past a point in one second. 
If there are 6.241 x 1018 electrons flowing through our frame in one second then the electrical current flowing through it is ‘One Ampere.’

# Current Formula
I=V/R
Where V is the voltage
R is the resistance

# What is Resistor Colour Code?
Resistors are usually very tiny, and it is challenging to print resistance values on them.
So, colour bands are printed on them to represent the electrical resistance. 
These colour bands are known as resistor colour code. The resistor colour code was invented in the 1920s by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA).

# Resistor Colour Reading
![Resistor colour reading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86143586/130083808-9b7ddcac-fd01-4125-a87b-da7b70619d66.JPG)

All leaded resistors with a power rating up to one watt are marked with colour bands.
They are given by several bands and together they specify the resistance value, the tolerance rate and sometimes the reliability or failure rates. 
The number of bands present in a resistor varies from three to six. 
The first two bands indicate the resistance value and the third band serves as a multiplier.

# Resistors in Series
The resistors R1, R2 ...., Rm in the circuit on the left side are said to be in series because the same current passes through them.
They behave in the same way as the circuit on the right of resistance Req given by the sum of the resistances R1, R2 and R3.
Req = R1 + R2 ....+ Rm
I = E / Req

![series resistance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86143586/130084263-83cea272-a2ff-4fb5-b83b-60b1874af852.JPG)

# Resistors in Parallel
The voltage across each of the resistors R1, R2 ...., Rm in the circuit on the left is the same and therefore these resistors are said to be in parallel.
They behave in the same way as the circuit on the right of resistance Req that is given by the equation:
1 / Req = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + .... + 1 / Rm

![parallel resistance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86143586/130084288-c4940687-12a4-45b0-9e00-0e22608332c3.JPG)

# Resistors combined[series and parallel]
Resistors can be connected together in 'n' number of series and parallel combinations to form complex resistive circuits and simplify the same.



# RMS Value of Current and Voltage

Definition: The RMS value is the effective value of a varying voltage or current. It is the equivalent steady DC (constant) value which gives the same effect.
For example: For example, a lamp connected to a 6V RMS AC supply will shine with the same brightness when connected to a steady 6V DC supply.

## Waveform

## RMS Formula

RMS Voltage= peak voltage * 0.707 

# DC Power

Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.

## Power Formulas in DC Circuits

P = V x I

P = I2 x R

P = V2 / R

# Average Value
The average of all the instantaneous values of an alternating voltage and currents over one complete cycle is called Average Value.

## Average Current
### Definition:
If we convert the alternating current (AC) sine wave into direct current (DC) sine wave through rectifiers, then the converted value to the DC is known as the average value of that alternating current sine wave
### Formula:
   Iavgx(π/ω) =  (2Im/ω)

   Iavg = (2Im / π)

     Iavg   = 0.637Im

The average value of AC sinusoidal current or voltage is equal to 0.637 times of its peak value.

## Average Voltage
### Definition:
The average voltage (or current) of a periodic waveform whether it is a sine wave, square wave or triangular waveform is defined as: “the quotient of the area under the waveform with respect to time”.
### Formula:
     Average Value of Voltage = EAV = 0.637 EM

# Kirchhoff VoLtage Law (KVL) 

Gustav Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) is the second of his fundamental laws we can use for circuit analysis. 
# Definition: 
For a closed loop series path the algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero (ΣV = 0). This is because a circuit loop is a closed conducting path so no energy is lost.

![dcp107](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80401577/130097149-63f239c4-a086-4ee7-a689-a09b19a6f921.gif)

For the above circuit, we get the following equation after applying KVL:
##  Vs -IR1 - IR2 = 0

For obtaining the loop currents in the circuit KVL is applied. 



# Number system conversion

1. BINARY TO EXCESS-3.
2. EXCESS-3 TO BINARY.
3. BINARY TO DECIMAL.
4. DECIMAL TO BINARY.
5. BINARY TO GRAY.
6. GRAY TO BINARY.
7. DECIMAL TO HEXADECIMAL
8. HEXADECIMAL TO DECIMAL

**DECIMAL NUMBER SYSYTEM** - The decimal, base-10 (den) or denary numbering system, each integer number column has values of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc as we move along the number from right to left.Then each position to the left of the decimal point indicates an increased positive power of 10.

**BINARY NUMBER SYSYTEM** - The Binary Numbering System is the most fundamental numbering system in all digital and computer based systems and binary numbers follow the same set of rules as the decimal numbering system. But unlike the decimal system which uses powers of ten, the binary numbering system works on powers of two giving a binary to decimal conversion from base-2 to base-10.

**EXCESS-3 NUMBER SYSYTEM** - Excess-3, 3-excess or 10-excess-3 binary code, shifted binary or Stibitz code is a self-complementary binary-coded decimal code and numeral system. It is a biased representation.

**HEXADECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM** - In the hexadecimal number system (hex) the numbers are represented with base 16,  Just like the binary number and decimal number whose base representation are 2 and 10, respectively. the hexadecimal conversion is also possible to other number system and vice versa.

**GREY CODE NUMBER SYSTEM** - A Grey code is an encoding of numbers so that the adjacent numbers have a single digit differing by one.
